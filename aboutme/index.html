        <p>Hello everyone, I'm currently a Software Engineer in my third semester. I'm from Colorado and I miss it a lot.<br>
        I don't know what I'm going to do in my future career yet, but I'm excited to learn more and eventually figure it out!</p>
        <p>My hobbies include longboarding, hiking, puzzle solving, building things, netflix, and a whole lot more. I have a cat named<br>
        Simba that I recently got. He's in the picture and he's pretty cool!</p>
