        My favorite kinds of data storage that I personally use are removable storage and my iCloud. Removable storage are things such as flash drives, hard drives, cd's, DVD's, or SD cards. These are more practical for older data that you don't often use and don't want to keep on your device taking away internal storage. I use them for old pictures, videos or essays that I don't want to take space on my computer. My iCloud keeps all of my devices linked and my data external so that I know my data is safe no matter what happens to a singular device. If you ever do lose Data but you have an iCloud sign-in on a separate device and see it it's there. You can also check to see if there's an older version of what you needed that you could just update. There really isn't much you can do after you have already lost data other than check the backups you have already made. This brings us to the point of preventative measures you can take for data loss incidents. You can load things onto a physical drive such as a flash drive, so there is a safe version elsewhere. You can also get some sort of account that stores our information such as an iCloud account. You could also make copies on your computer in a duplicate folder using software such as FreeFileSync that makes a copy folder.
